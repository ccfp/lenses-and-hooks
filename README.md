# Lenses ðŸ‘“ & Hooks ðŸŽ£

**ðŸŽ¯ Ambitious goals:** The aim of this session/workshop/whatever-it-is is to implement a custom React hook that will utilize lenses for state management. The inspiration is AndrÃ© Staltz's [`use-profunctor-state`](https://github.com/staltz/use-profunctor-state) library. Here's the accompanying talk: ["Profunctor Optics for State Management"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdiJ_vgVUgs).

To be honest, I don't really know what profunctors are all about ([_and maybe AndrÃ© doesn't either?_](https://www.twitter.com/andrestaltz/status/1063704967209455616)), but I think we should be able to implement something similar with regular old lenses brought in from `ramda` or `partial.lenses`. We could also try implementing our own `set`/`view`/`over` functions from scratch (or, mostly from scratch, as it probably would be easier to rely on optics implementations from one of the above libraries).

The idea is that you can replace Redux with a top-level state object and use lenses to get and set from state. At least, that's the promise, but I don't know---I am still learning Redux so we'll see how this goes ðŸ˜‰.
